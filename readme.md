# What is Hive Mind Society

Hive Mind Society Overview:

** The information requires facts verification. The research is in progress. **

The phenomenon known also as GangStalking.

### Core Definition:

Centralized US-created and US-controlled collective consciousness system where multiple individual minds are interconnected through neural technology (BCI) to create a shared cognitive network.
- MITM-type communication, orchestrated by centralized AI system as an operator. The data is stored near OpenAI and Azure data centers - military-grade level of protection.
- Active onboarding inside multiple closed social circles like private business clubs, rotary club, freemasonry around the World. 
- Corporations-level onboarding is in the active phase.
- Active onboarding of specific social groups, selected algorithmically.
- Oboarded around 7% of population on Earth. 

**Techno-authoritarianism**, also known as **IT-backed authoritarianism**, **digital authoritarianism** or **digital dictatorship**,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno-authoritarianism#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno-authoritarianism#cite_note-:1-2) refers to the state use of information technology in order to control or manipulate both foreign and domestic populations.

### Problems:

1. Criminal illegal covert onboarding against medical protocols, without agreements, with no permissions, against regulations and laws;
2. Severe human rights violations on all levels. Unethical and criminal practices inside the network; 
3. All operations are kept in secret - no transparency;
4. Truth is distorted. Distortion of information within the network by the centralized AI orchestrator;
5. The system itself uses manipulative techniques to keep a human against his will inside the network;
6. Social engineering is used to onboard members;
7. Manipulative tactics against members - target goal is to influence geo-political and business decisions on all levels, in 100% of the countries and organizations;
8. Unfair practices against partially connected individuals (remote neural monitoring mode) - surveillance, distant BCI control without any permissions;
9. Equality is absent - the network is separated into groups / clusters, and hierarchical levels
10. Lack of trust - the technology provider is literally remains unknown. However deductive research leads to the root within US-elites and US-defence orgs circles.
11. No public technical information about the exact technology used. It leads to numerous concerns about the reliability and security.


### Onboarding stages (similar to destructive sects):

1. Invasion by bio-active substances, presumably graphene-oxide based
2. BCI activation and tuning
3. Silent brain monitoring phase - full remote surveillance
4. Synthetic dreams and consciousness manipulation
5. About 20 multi-level strategies for onboarding - fundamenally based on: manipulations, lie, deception, threatening, bribes and corruption, synthetic drugs (using BCI)
6. Partial BCI activation - 1-2 interfaces (tactile + audio, for example)
7. Full BCI activation (all senses) and deep integration into the network - loss of free will, loss of individuality, inability to escape
8. In 70% of the cases: inability to percieve and understand mind slavery - altered mindset

### Corporate world

1. Utilized silently for surveillance against contractors and employees - rude violation of human rights and privacy
2. Popularization as a tool for hidden communication via multiple channels
3. Proposes material compensation (bribes, corruption, black schemes) for the system support and popularization
4. Used for threatening and manipulations against those who are not connected or partially connected
5. Prevents any attempts for direct and honest communication about the tool usage. The tool itself is a kind of a "tabu".
6. Discriminative policies for selecting job candidates based on "connected" / "disconnected" status

### Streets behavior

1. Society members instructed about micro-tasks through neural interfaces - all for rewards and gamification using BCI
2. Block a person - car incidents, block a car, block a street, block someone in a transport, etc.
3. Non-direct threatening - shouting, whispering relevant words, etc.
4. Gaslighting - organized scenes designed specifically for someone
5. Support a person of interest - provides guidance and support for selected ones - those who support the system
6. Prevent crimes - intelligently identifies and early prevents street crimes
7. Monitor streets via eyes and ears of connected - full-mode surveillance to scan street crowds
8. Onboarding of members by showing gestures and key phrases to control BCI - everything is organized to make it feel like an elite club, but in fact it's a US-organized mind slavery
9. Micro-operations: help someone to find the road (via hidden gestures), direct someone, recommend to avoid something, etc.
10. In the worst case scenario: support for assasination operations (without awarness of network members)

### Home behavior

1. No privacy at all - all life, including thoughts and visual images - tracked, recorded and analyzed by AI for further exploitation of human mind
2. Partially information is broadcasted to neighbours - around 1-3km radius, depending on density of buildings
3. High-level members can control BCI of low-level members: it means full access to real-time data, senses injections (audio/video/tactile/pain), dreams manipulations, etc.
4. AI orchestrator has unlimited access to all BCIs at any moment of time

### Work behavior (for targeted individuals)

1. Always monitoring your work - no chance to stop the monitoring.
2. Intrusive behavior to "optimize" your efficiency, in other terms, "digital slavery".
