# What is Hive Mind Society

Hive Mind Society Overview:

** The information requires facts verification. The research is in progress. **

### Core Definition:

Centralized US-created and US-controlled collective consciousness system where multiple individual minds are interconnected through neural technology to create a shared cognitive network.
- MITM-type communication, orchestrated by centralized AI system as an operator. The data is stored near OpenAI and Azure data centers - military-grade level of protection.
- Active onboarding inside multiple closed social circles like private business clubs, rotary club, freemasonry around the World. 
- Corporations-level onboarding is in the active phase.
- Active onboarding of specific social groups, selected algorithmically.
- Oboarded around 7% of population on Earth. 

### Problems:

1. Criminal illegal covert onboarding against medical protocols, without agreements, with no permissions, against regulations and laws;
2. Severe human rights violations on all levels. Unethical and criminal practices inside the network; 
3. All operations are kept in secret - no transparency;
4. Truth is distorted. Distortion of information within the network by the centralized AI orchestrator;
5. The system itself uses manipulative techniques to keep a human against his will inside the network;
6. Social engineering is used to onboard members;
7. Manipulative tactics against members - target goal is to influence geo-political and business decisions on all levels, in 100% of the countries and organizations;
8. Unfair practices against partially connected individuals (remote neural monitoring mode) - surveillance, distant BCI control without any permissions;
9. Equality is absent - the network is separated into groups / clusters, and hierarchical levels
10. Lack of trust - the technology provider is literally remains unknown. However deductive research leads to the root within US-elites and US-defence orgs circles.
11. No public technical information about the exact technology used. It leads to numerous concerns about the reliability and security.

Technical Components:

1. Neural Infrastructure
- Synchronized BCI networks
- Cloud-based cognitive processing
- Neural data synchronization
- Collective decision algorithms

2. Integration Methods
- Direct neural linking
- Thought synchronization
- Emotional state sharing

Social Structure:

1. Hierarchy Models
- Centralized, hierarchical nodes system
- Multi-level access control
- Roles and permissions within groups
- Peer-to-peer networks
- AI-based orchestration and monitoring

2. Communication Protocols
- Tactile Signal transmission (specific touch BCI interface)
- Shared experiential data
- Real-time neural feedback

Potential Risks:

1. Political risks
- Totalitarian full thoughts monitoring and control
- Single, global control of all organizations and political entities on the planet
- Loss of autonomy
- Cognitive homogenization
- Privacy concerns

2. Security Vulnerabilities 
- Massive physical harm at scale by unpredicted factors
- Neural network attacks
- Collective manipulation
- Data corruption
- Identity theft

3. Social Impact
- Power concentration
- Social division
- Cultural shifts
- Ethics concerns

Protection Framework:

1. Technical Safeguards
- BCI detection framework
- Neural firewalls: brain barrier concept
- Neural blockchain mechanism
- Neural structure, neural pathways snapshots

2. Legal/Ethical Guidelines
- Individual rights protection
- Consent requirements
- Safety standards

Current Status:
Active expansion and onboarding - popularization of the concept in mass media.
